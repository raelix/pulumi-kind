It is based on the Kind Terraform Provider.

## Configuration
WIP
The following configuration points are available for the `kind` provider:

- `kind:apiKey` (environment: `kind_API_KEY`) - the API key for `kind`
- `kind:region` (environment: `kind_REGION`) - the region in which to deploy resources

## Reference

## Developer

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed and present in your `$PATH`:

- [`pulumictl`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumictl#installation)
- [Go 1.17](https://golang.org/dl/) or 1.latest
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14.x.  We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage NodeJS installations.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (called as `python3`).  For recent versions of MacOS, the system-installed version is fine.
- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### Create the schema by running the following command:
Create the schema necessary to build the plugin
```bash
make tfgen
```

### Build the provider 
Build the binary and ensure there are no warnings about unmapped resources and no warnings about unmapped data sources:
```bash
make provider
```

### Build the SDKs
Build the SDKs in the various languages Pulumi supports:
```bash
make build_sdks
```

### Ensure the build
Run this command to ensure the Golang SDK is a proper go module:
```bash
cd sdk && go mod tidy && cd -
```

### Expose the provider
Copy the `pulumi-resource-kind` binary generated by `make provider` and place it in your `$PATH` (`$GOPATH/bin` is a convenient choice), e.g.:
```bash
cp bin/pulumi-resource-kind $GOPATH/bin
```
